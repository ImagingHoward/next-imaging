  biography: `
  I am a recent Howard University graduate with a B.S. in Biology and a minor in Chemistry. Projects I'm working on during my internship include assisting in the design and creation of equipment for conducting MRI scans on mice and rats, assisting in the preparation and mounting of brain tissue samples from non-human primates for histological analysis, and performing imaging and analysis of mounted slides using advanced microscopy techniques. My research interests lie in clinical and/ or biomedical sciences, where I aim to contribute to medical advancements and patient care. During my internship, I hope to deepen my knowledge and understanding of imaging and histological analysis techniques, paving the way for a career in research or the medical field. A fun fact about me is that I am ambidextrous, which often comes in handy in the lab!
