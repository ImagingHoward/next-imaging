  biography: `
  My name is Russell Antwi, and I am a senior Biology major at Howard University. Over the summer, I have had the privilege of working under Dr. Dominique Pritchett, focusing on interpreting gamma band oscillations through MATLAB to uncover potential links to schizophrenia. My career aspiration is to become a neurosurgeon, and this internship has been an invaluable opportunity to immerse myself in various scientific disciplines and explore their interconnectedness. Additionally, I have a deep passion for music, as I believe that sounds have a unique way of activating my dopamine response.
